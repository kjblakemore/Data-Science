# Introduction to Data Science

This repository contains projects from the <i>Introduction to Data Science</i> course taught by Bill Howe of the University of Washington in the summer of 2014 and offered through Coursera.

In this course R, Python and SQL were used to solve various data science problems.

## Models and Algorithms Developed
* Analysis of tweets in terms of sentiment, term frequency and hash tag frequency.
* Similarity matrices to identify similar stories and search for keywords in the Reuters Database.
* Map-reduce algorithms in Python to create unique, trimmed DNA sequences and analyze social networks, calculating friend counts and identifying asymmetric friendships.
* Accuracy comparison of ocean microbe classification using R machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forest and support vector machine).
* K* classifier from Weka to solve the Kaggle Forest Cover competition.
